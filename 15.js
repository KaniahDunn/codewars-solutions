// Find the Difference in Age between Oldest and Youngest Family Members

// At the annual family gathering, the family likes to find the oldest living family member’s age and the youngest family member’s age and calculate the difference between them.

// You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed ‘age’ of 0. Return a new array (a tuple in Python) with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].

function differenceInAges(ages) {
    const min = Math.min(...ages);
    const max = Math.max(...ages);

    return [min, max, max - min];
}

/*Convert a Boolean to a String

In this programming exercise, you're going to learn about functions, boolean (true/false) values, strings, and the if-statement.

A function is a block of code that takes an input and produces an output. In this example, boolean_to_string is a function whose input is either true or false, and whose output is the string representation of the input, either "true"/"True" or "false"/"False" (check the sample tests about what capitalization to use in a given language).

A common idea we often want to represent in code is the concept of true and false. A variable that can either be true or false is called a boolean variable. In this example, the input to boolean_to_string (represented by the variable b) is a boolean.

Lastly, when we want to take one action if a boolean is true, and another if it is false, we use an if-statement.

For this kata, don't worry about edge cases like where unexpected input is passed to the function. You'll get to worry about these enough in later exercises.*/


function booleanToString(b){
    return b ? 'true' : 'false';
  }
